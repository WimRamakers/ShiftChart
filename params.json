{"name":"Shiftchart","tagline":"A simple JavaScript webapp to generate nice, and printable, rpm vs speed curves for all gears of your car/bike/lawnmower on steroids.","body":"### What & why\r\nThis project started when I was learning JavaScript/jQuery, and wanted a real world challenge. Since my tool to print such images was Microsoft Excel at that time, I decided to expand the functionality and make it platform independent as a web app. I'm now going open source because other people might have good ideas for new features and want to help to create the ultimate tool. I must warn you guys, the code is not very clean since a lot of work was done at the time i was just learning Javascript...\r\n\r\n### Implemented features\r\n- sliders to see what influence changes have just by dragging a slider\r\n- torque curve based optimal acceleration shift point calculation for those who think that the rpm limiter is always the best shift point\r\n- multiple setups can be compared\r\n- values on image when only one setup\r\n- saving of setups and views (=some setups together) as private or public when an account is generated\r\n- print stylesheet\r\n\r\n### Planned features and improvements\r\n- improve layout\r\n- mobile optimized layout\r\n- rewrite code in clean style\r\n- ?? your wishes\r\n\r\n### Sponsoring & promoting\r\nIt would be nice to have some people promoting www.shiftchart.eu around the web, and to get a couple of dollars/euros as donation or sponsoring to pay the domain name and hosting (I'm not mentioning my programming time here, you can't afford that anyway... ;-) ).","google":"43147517","note":"Don't delete this file!
